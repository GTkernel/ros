# Robot Operation System (ROS) 

Robot Operating System ([ROS](https://www.ros.org)) is a C++/Python library and tool for developing robot applications.
It allows us to emulate IoT automation applications (such as in industrial IoT) without using actual IoT devices.
ROS have two series of distribution for development: ROS 1 and ROS 2. ROS 2 will eventually replace ROS 1 (in 2025),
but now ROS 1 is still dominated in productions for its more complete features.
One difference between ROS 1 and 2 is the communication between components.
ROS 1 is in centralized management. Every application requires to have a **core** components as the coordinator.

## How to start

While users can build different ROS applicaions, they are seperated in different directories in this repo.
Please refer to specific one for more instruction.
Currently only has pub-sub one: it is the C++ example package of ROS 1,
one publisher and one subscriber share the same topic.
